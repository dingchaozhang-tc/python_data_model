    "## Summary\n",
    "By implmenting special methods len and getitem, our frenchdeck behaves like a standard python sequence, allowing it to benefit from core language features e.g. iteration and slicing from standard library: random.choice, reversed, sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Implementing special/dunder methods to make objects behave like the built-in types, rather than reinvieting wheels\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Special methods allow objects to benefit from the rich Python standard library\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Special Methods are not meant to be called directly, use built-in functions instead\n",
    "- Special methods are used is that they are meant to be called by the python interpreter, not by us, unless we are doing metaprogramming, the only special method that is frequently called by user code directly is __init__, to invoke the superclass in your own __init__ implementation. We don't write my_object.__len__(). we write len(my_object), and if my_object is an instance of a user-defined class, then Python calls the __len__ instance method we implemented.\n",
    "- These built-ins call the corresponding special method, and interpreter takes a shortcut: the cpython implementation of len() actually returns the value of the ob_size field in PyVarObject C struct that represents any variable-sized built-in object in memory, this is much faster than calling a method.\n",
    "- The special method call is implicit, for example, the statement for i in x: actually causes the invocations of iter(x), which in turn may call x.__iter__() if that is available. If we need to invoke a special method, it is usually better to call the related built-in function(e.g,; len, iter, str,etc).\n",
